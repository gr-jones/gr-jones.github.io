        I’ve been doing ice baths for the last couple of weeks and find the benefits others report to be true. 
        I do feel a rush when I exit the ice bath and warm up naturally in the sun. 
        I do find my toes hurt like hell while in the tub. 
        I do find myself focusing on my breathing as a mental coping mechanism for the freezing sensation I encounter while in the tub. 
        However, as I’ve become more familiar with ice baths and completing more ice bath sessions, I’m beginning to question the resilience it builds because I find I am becoming accustomed to the sensation.

        To me resilience is the ability to endure discomfort. Likewise, the scary or difficult part of discomfort is not so much the sensation of a disruption in my homeostasis, but, rather, having to endure this sensation for an unknown length of time.

        From conversations in the sauna with others at Squatch who also do contrast therapy, we all seem to be following this routine of 15 or so minutes of sauna followed by 3 or so minutes of cold plunge/ice bath and then repeating this cycle 2 more times for a total cycle count of 3. It has come up a couple of times - maybe once or twice - but I question where these numbers come from. I do know this 3x15 mins sauna + 3 mins cold plunge routine comes from Andrew Huberman - who most people at Squatch follow - but I don’t know where Huberman is getting this information. Do I feel better from this routine? Yeah I do. I just wonder, from the perspective of building resistance - the ability to endure discomfort - is having a set routine like this a correct practice?

        The other day when sitting in the ice bath, I found myself being able to stay in the cold plunge longer than 3 minutes, rather easily. Now, what’s the longest I’ve stayed in the ice bath? Maybe 3.5 minutes and that’s with my hands being out of the water. I just started to fully submerge my toes during my plunge and this has intensified the activity. However, I’ve begun to submerge my toes because I found myself being able to endure the plunge with little discomfort or at least I no longer panic like when I first started doing ice baths. From this realization, I’ve begun to wonder if true discomfort - for me - is when I don’t know when something is going to end.

        I think I want to build up my ability to handle panic and having a set time for the an ice bath removes much of the panic I experience. Panic arises, for me, when I begin to think an uncomfortable situation is going to continue forever. Permanent discomfort makes me think of damage and I’m terrified of sustaining permanent damage. An effective coping mechanism for the experience of panic is telling myself things will be ok and the discomfort is only temporary. A known ice bath duration cheapens my exposure and practice with using this thought pattern. Likewise, if everyone can complete this set contrast therapy routine and most people are bad at handling discomfort I wonder if this routine is truly effective at learning to handle discomfort.

        While I need to explore these thoughts more, I’m curious about how using a timer of random length would impact my practice. For example, for the cold plunge, I have a hunch that using a timer of random length would be better at teaching me how to handle the uncomfortable thought of “how long will this pain last?”. I should create an app on my phone that picks a random time between 1-5 minutes, start the timer and then get into the ice bath to test my idea.
